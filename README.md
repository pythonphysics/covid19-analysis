# A personal project of mine to analyse the COVID19 cases by country
* Everything is kept open source
* Data is freely available from CSSE-JHU which is also open source with the link available [here](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19 "CSSE-JHU COVID19 Time Series Data")
* Will be trying to create data visualisation of all the countries with various statistical analysis.
* May incorporate some basic Machine Learning techniques to predict the time series data project available later on
